## Purpose of the ReadMe Generator

The ReadMe generator is a tool designed to automatically generate ReadMe files based on user input and coding files. Its purpose is to ease the process of maintaining up-to-date and consistent ReadMe files for projects.

## Usage

To use the ReadMe generator, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Run the Script

Run the script by navigating to the project directory and running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
node script_name.js -i path_to_coding_file
```

### Step 2: Answer the Prompts

The script will then prompt the user to input the following information:

- Project title
- Project description
- Project features

### Step 3: Review and Save

Once the user has input the required information, the script will generate a ReadMe file based on the user's input and coding file. The generated ReadMe file will be saved in the same directory as the script.

## Example Coding File
```javascript
# code that can be included in the ReadMe file
```
Note: The example above assumes that the `generateReadme` function is properly implemented in the `./generator.js` file.
